Description: MsRadaR contains functions to build a de-novo structural elucidation
    pipeline for double bond positions of lipid molecules from centroided MS/MS 
    spectra. Elemental formula and elemental formula loss (EFL) assignment can 
    be performed. The experimental determined EFL are compared to that of a 
    saturated alkyl chain CH3(CH2)n to determine the delta H difference related 
    to the appearance of double bonds. Characteristic delta H differences are 
    normalized and can be visualized as relative intensities or intensity slopes. 
    Intensity maxima peak picking is performed to spot putative double bond 
    positions. Different m/z values can be used as starting points for CH3(CH2)n 
    deltaH series. Additionally, fragments related to the fatty acid composition 
    can be visualized and indicate whether a neutral or radical loss occurred.
