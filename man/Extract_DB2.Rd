\title{Extract Alternative Double Bond Series and Corresponding Plots}
\usage{
Extract_DB2(Data = Additional_DB_Series)
}
\arguments{
\item{Data}{A data frame containing additional double bond series. Default is \code{Additional_DB_Series}.}
}
\value{
A list containing the extracted plots for starting points and double bond series,
each annotated with appropriate titles based on the data names.
}

This function extracts alternative double bond series and their corresponding plots
from a given data set of additional double bond series. It processes filtered double bonds
and loss heights, generating visualizations for each data entry.
