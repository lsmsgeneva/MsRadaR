\title{Extract Fatty Acid (FA) Candidates from Peak Data}
\usage{
Extract_FA_Losses(
  Data,
  FA_Peaks,
  Fa_Number = (Precursor_DF$O - 3),
  Precursor_Df,
  Backbone_C = 3,
  O_Count = c(1, 2)
)
}
\arguments{
\item{Data}{A data frame containing the MS/MS spectrum data, including columns
for \code{C} (number of carbon atoms) and \code{O} (number of oxygen atoms).}

\item{FA_Peaks}{A numeric vector of fatty acid peaks to be extracted.}

\item{Fa_Number}{Numeric. The number of fatty acid components to consider,
calculated as \code{Precursor_DF$O - 3}.}

\item{Precursor_Df}{A data frame containing precursor information, including
columns for carbon and oxygen counts.}

\item{Backbone_C}{Numeric. The carbon count of the backbone, which is subtracted
from the precursor carbon count (default: 3).}

\item{O_Count}{Numeric vector. A vector of allowable oxygen counts to filter the
data (default: c(1, 2)).}
}
\value{
A data frame containing potential fatty acid candidates based on the
specified conditions. Returns NA if no fatty acid peaks are provided.
}
\description{
This function extracts potential fatty acid candidates from a given dataset based
on specified peaks and conditions. It generates combinations of peaks, filters
them based on precursor data, and computes related properties. Only combinations
that match the precursor mass will be considered.
